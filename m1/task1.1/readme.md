# Experiments with GIT

In this task i theateorized the situation where multiple dev teams work on project simultaneously. I had prodaction (main) branch and one dev branch to where all completed work have been merged and lastly dev branch merged into production branch. Here i enchanced my knowlage about margin and swithing to branches. I also had some difficulties with resolving conflicts with bash console. I used to do this kind of work with VSCode or IntelliJ Idea not with gvimdiff.

## Just a little addition
I also enhanced my knowlage about [markdown language.](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

# My thoughts about DevOps

DevOps is rather methodology than specific proffession. Relatevely new way to efficiently go throuht development circle of any product on digital market. As a methodology, it spiced with a bit of philosophy. Some deffinitions called DevOps a philosophy, but i preffer to be more restrained and take more akademic approach while defining this notion. DevOps also implies some specific set of knowledge which is essential to those who dare to become a DevOps engineer.
